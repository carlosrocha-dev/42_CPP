The delivery of these modules focuses on introducing Object-Oriented Programming as a foundational aspect of C++ education. C++ has been selected due to its roots in the familiar C language.

For those interested in advancing their skills in contemporary C++ practices, further self-study beyond these introductory modules is recommended.
